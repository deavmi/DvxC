I need to rethink interruot mechanism



Raise 34?
movb 34 h

interrupt, sets flag

This then shortly after int instruction, jumps to vect_table+%h=vect_table+34



What about hardwrae raised interrupts,

we want to store instruction and all, maybe in gex?

So it sets flags, via int instruction, sets h (for type of interrupt), but also then stores in gex,so many combos
